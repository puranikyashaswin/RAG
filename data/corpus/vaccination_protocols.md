# Vaccination Protocols for Children Under 5

## Overview
Vaccination is a cornerstone of preventive healthcare for children under 5 years old. This protocol outlines recommended schedules, contraindications, and administration guidelines based on CDC and WHO recommendations. Timely vaccination protects against vaccine-preventable diseases and contributes to herd immunity.

## Recommended Schedule
Vaccinations should be administered at specific ages to ensure optimal immune response. Delays may require catch-up schedules.

- **Adverse Events**: Monitor for fever, redness at injection site; report serious events to VAERS.

## Catch-Up Vaccination
For children behind schedule:
