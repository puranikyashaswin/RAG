# Diabetes Management Guidelines

## Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Effective management is crucial to prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for healthcare providers.

## Diagnosis
- **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**: ≥126 mg/dL indicates diabetes.
- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL.
- **HbA1c**: ≥6.5% confirms diagnosis.
- **Random Plasma Glucose**: ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms.

## Classification
- **Type 1 Diabetes**: Autoimmune destruction of beta cells; requires insulin.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: Insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency; managed with lifestyle, oral agents, or insulin.
- **Gestational Diabetes**: Occurs during pregnancy; resolves postpartum but increases risk of type 2.

## Treatment
### Lifestyle Modifications
- **Diet**: Balanced, low glycemic index foods; aim for 45-60% carbohydrates.
- **Exercise**: At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week.
- **Weight Management**: Target BMI <25 kg/m².

### Pharmacological Therapy
- **Metformin**: First-line for type 2; reduces hepatic glucose production.
- **Sulfonylureas**: Stimulate insulin secretion; risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Insulin**: Essential for type 1; basal-bolus regimens for type 2.
- **GLP-1 Agonists**: Promote weight loss and glycemic control.

## Monitoring
- **Blood Glucose**: Self-monitoring 4-6 times daily for insulin users.
- **HbA1c**: Target <7% for most patients; <6.5% for younger or healthier individuals.
- **Complications Screening**: Annual eye, kidney, and foot exams.

## Complications Prevention
- **Cardiovascular Risk**: Statins for LDL >100 mg/dL; ACE inhibitors for hypertension.
- **Nephropathy**: Annual microalbuminuria testing; ACE/ARB for albuminuria.
- **Neuropathy**: Foot care education; pain management.

## Patient Education
Educate patients on self-management, recognizing hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia, and when to seek medical help. Encourage participation in diabetes education programs.

## Conclusion
Comprehensive management combining lifestyle, medications, and monitoring reduces diabetes-related complications. Individualize care based on patient needs and comorbidities.
